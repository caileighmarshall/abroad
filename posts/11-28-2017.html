			<h1>Capitals v. Stars</h1>
			<h6><span class="light">Edinburgh, Scotland - </span> November 28, 2017</h6>
			
			<p>On Sunday night, I ventured out to the Murrayfield ice rink to watch the Edinburgh Capitals take on the Dundee Stars. I thoroughly enjoyed the chanting and screams of fans with indiscernible Scottish accents. The Dundee Stars are ranked 11/12 in the Elite League, which is better than the Edinburgh Capitals ranking of 12/12. The Capitals went into the game as the underdog and emerged with a 5-3 victory.</p>

			<p>The first goal of the game was by Johan Andersson after 10 minutes of play, giving Dundee a 0-1 lead.</p>

			<p>With about five minutes remaining in the first period, Trakhanov was high-sticked and left the ice immediately for treatment, blood running down his face. He would return in the second period wearing a full visor. In the pause while the ice was cleaned, the Capitals were awarded a double minor high sticking penalty for the injury caused. Ten seconds later, the Star's Stadel sent the puck out of the defensive end over the glass, and earned a two minute delay of game penalty as a result. This gave the Capitals a 5 on 3 powerplay for a full two minutes.</p>

			<p>They only needed just over a minute of it before a goal by Upitis to tie the game 1-1. This left Dundee in the unusual position of still being on a 5 on 3 despite the power play goal. The referee and linesmen took some time to discuss this but arrived at the correct decision â€“ because the goal was scored during the first penalty of the double minor, it was that penalty which was cancelled, the second penalty of the double minor was then started, leaving Capitals with a 5 on 3 for the remaining 53 seconds for the delay of game penalty.</p>

			<p>The Capitals took full advantage, with Teslyukevich getting a second goal nine seconds before the delay of game penalty ended. The double powerplay ended when Anderson scored a third goal. Three power play goals for the Capitals and three goals scored in less than two minutes. Wow.</p>

			<p>About 30 seconds after the powerplay ended, Banashkov scored a fourth goal, taking the Capitals to 4-1 as the first period came to an end.</p>

			<p>The second period started with the Stars opening the period with a quick goal with less than a minute gone, Hart scoring unassisted.</p>

			<p>Then the fighting ensued. After a brief scuffle, both teams played 4 on 4, followed by a short Capitals powerplay that ended with a goal by Mimar from the Stars. The buffer the Capitals had created was slowly diminishing, as the score became 4-3.</p>

			<p>Capitals regrouped and shortly after, Cazzola scored the Capitals fifth goal of the game to restore the Capitals lead to 5-3.</p>

			<p>The third period featured a fist fight. Kolesnikovs and Hyrnrk both got a ten minute misconduct for fighting without gloves, which left them in the box until the end of the game.</p>

			<p>Somehow, the Capitals kept their 5-3 lead for the last five minutes. The Stars pulled Fullerton (their goalie) with about 2:40 to play, giving them 6 on 5, but neither team scored. The Capitals won the game 5-3.</p>

			<p>I also included a highlights reel from the game, in case this play-by-play wasn't the easiest to follow. Not my normal blog post, but I couldn't resist including the hockey game in my blog after such a great win. :)</p>

			<p>Cheers!</p>
