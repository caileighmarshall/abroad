			<h1>Craigmillar Castle</h1>
			<h6><span class="light">Edinburgh, Scotland - </span> October 16, 2017</h6>
			
			<p>Yesterday I decided to make the trek to Craigmillar Castle, Edinburgh's "other castle." It was a bus ride and a 10 minute uphill walk to get there, but it was a beautiful day and I was in no rush. The castle itself is one of the most preserved castles in Scotland, even though it is in ruin. It was built in the early 15th century and still retains its medieval character.</p>

			<p>The castle played an important part in the story of Mary Queen of Scots, who fled to Craigmillar Castle following the birth of her son, James IV, and the murder of Rizzio in 1566 (see my blog post about <a href="https://caileighmarshall.github.io/abroad/posts/09-19-2017.html" target="new">Holyrood Palace</a> for the story surrounding his murder). It was in the castle where the plot (called the "Craigmillar Bond") was hatched to murder Mary's husband, Lord Darnley. The plot was complex but, finally, on the night of February 9th, 1567, Darnley's town house was blown up. When his body was found nearby, it was clear the he had been strangled to death.</p>

			<p>In 1660, the castle, previously owned by the Preston family, was sold to Sir John Gilmour, Lord President of the Court of Session. He made a large number of alterations on the castle, due to the castle being considered very old-fashioned for the time. Sir John rebuilt the West Range to create a residence appropriate to his status and to include more private rooms, which was a common feature of grand houses during the 17th century. The Gilmours left Craigmillar in the 18th century, and the castle fell into romantic ruin by 1775.</p>

			<p>The main reason Craigmillar ended up on my list of must-sees in Edinburgh was because it appeared as Ardsmuir Prison in the current season (season 3) of Outlander. It is at the prison that Jamie is imprisoned, with other highland Jacobites, by the British Army. There were only brief glimpses of the castle in the episode, but having an Outlander filming location so close to my flat made me have to add the castle to my list of blog posts.</p>

			<p>Overall, I really enjoyed wandering through the passageways and almost being blown away while taking photos at the top of the castle. My favorite part of the castle was, hands down, the courtyard. In the courtyard, there are a pair of old Yew trees that were planted to create an entrance feature to the castle. Historically, they are believed to have provided wood for bows and arrows. I thought the whole atmosphere of the courtyard was magical, almost like being in a Disney Princess movie.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Cheers!</p>
