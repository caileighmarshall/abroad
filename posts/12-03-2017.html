			<h1>Alfie & Pantomime</h1>
			<h6><span class="light">Edinburgh & Glasgow, Scotland - </span> December 3, 2017</h6>
			
			<p>I had a few very interesting days this week, so I figured I would elaborate on them. The first is when I met Alfie Deyes, creator of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnEn0EUV13IR-_TK7fiIp3g" target="new">PointlessBlog on Youtube</a> and someone I watch daily. The second is the Cinderella Christmas Pantomime show in Glasgow.</p>

			<p>Thursday evening, St. Andrew's Day, I was preparing for the ceilidh being held in Teviot when I was browsing Instagram and watched Zoella's and Alfie's Instagram stories just to see what they were up to. I was shocked when I saw the Sir Walter Scott monument on Princes street in a few of their photos. They were in Edinburgh! Apparently last year they came to Edinburgh on November 30th as well, so I was able to browse their past videos to see roughly what they did last year on which days. I was determined to attempt to find them tomorrow at the Christmas market, where I thought they would be given Zoe loves Christmas and they didn't really explore the market on Thursday.

			</p>

			
			<p>Thankfully I had to go to Princes street anyway on Friday afternoon to renew my bus pass and buy train tickets to Glasgow for the Christmas pantomime on Saturday. I left around 2:30pm, guessing that they [Alfie, Zoe, and friends] would be at the Christmas market just before sunset (which is 4pm in Edinburgh). I arrived at the Christmas market just after 3pm and wandered the stalls for a bit, keeping my eyes peeled. When I had no success, I looked at Instagram again to see where they were, and they were ice skating, so I headed out towards the entrance of the market in the direction of the ice skating rink. I asked someone who worked in the market where the rink was, and they said to take a right and go down to the end of the block before taking a left. So I headed down the street, looking around, when I literally ran straight into them. I spotted Mark Ferris first (he is very tall and easy to spot) and then saw literally everyone walk into the market right in front of me. I was able to say hi to Alfie (everyone else was huddled up together trying to figure out what they wanted to do) and he was nice enough to take a selfie and chat for a minute. I was a little sad about not getting a photo with Zoe, but I didn't want to corner the whole group when they were obviously busy. I was just glad to get a photo with Alfie. :)</p>

			<p>After a successful mission, I was quite shaky the rest of the evening. I was probably slightly in shock that I actually 1) found them and 2) ran into them literally on the street. You hear about people running into celebrities in random places but I never thought it would happen to me. It was a Christmas miracle!</p>

			<p>Saturday was not as amazing but still enjoyable. I went to the Cinderella Christmas Pantomime in Glasgow with Arcadia. I was expecting a very *interesting* show, but it turned out to be quite kid friendly. There wasn't really any cross dressing and besides some silly costumes and dancing as if it was a disco, it was very tame. I enjoyed the banter between the audience and the cast. We had fun being mean to the evil stepmother and helping Cinderella out.</p>

			<p>The best part of the theatre production was the fact that the story was different from any other version I've read about Cinderella. This time, she was a princess who, because she was sassy, was delegated to the kitchen where she fell in love with a kitchen boy. She did go to balls with a prince, but the prince was narcissistic and didn't care about what her opinion was, so she ditched the prince for the kitchen boy instead. Very cute story! :)</p>

			<p>Overall, a great ending to my last week of classes!</p>

			<p>Cheers!</p>
