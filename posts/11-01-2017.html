			<h1>Scottish Highlands</h1>
			<h6><span class="light">Inverness, Scotland - </span> November 1, 2017</h6>
			<p>For my last Arcadia trip, I ventured back out to the Scottish highlands.</p>

			<p>Saturday was very similar to the Isle of Skye trip - we toured Doune castle, went through Glencoe, and saw Loch Ness. We did, however, visit Urquhart castle (which is on Loch Ness). The castle dates back to when St. Columba left the island of Iona in Ireland to visit the Pictish clan living where Urquhart castle is today. Eventually the castle became a medieval stronghold and was frequently fought over between the MacDonald and Grant families. When the Glorious Revolution happened, Jacobite supporters failed to seize the castle. This attempt convinced the government soldiers occupying the castle (supporters of the crown rather than the Jacobites) to march out of the castle in 1692 and blow it up using large barrels of gunpowder. Urquhart is probably one of my favorite ruined castles in Scotland because of its medieval past and idyllic location. After the visit to the castle, we drove on to Inverness where we stayed the night at a hostel.</p>

			<p>Sunday was an exciting day. We started at the Battlefield of Culloden, which was overwhelming and definitely depressing. I went through the museum first, which had a lot of artifacts and information on what led up to the battle. My favorite (albeit sad and nerve-wracking) part of the museum was the interactive exhibit, where you walk into a room with videos projected on all four sides and the battle commences with you standing in the middle of it all. You could hear the bullets whizzing by you and see a soldier get shot from a Red Coat rifle. Very eye-opening to what it would have felt like on the day of the battle. After the museum, we went out on to the battlefield. It was enlightening to see the flags (red for British, blue for Jacobite) that marked the lines the soldiers were in at the start of the battle. You could almost feel like you were there, watching the other party in the distance. There was a memorial (pile of stones) that was dedicated in the 1800s to the men who died in the battle. The number of casualties for the Jacobites was staggering because of their location on the field. The landscape on the British side, albeit not great, was better than the extremely boggy, heavily planted side of the Jacobites, who would have had to trek through mud up to their knees to be able to fight the British. What's worse was that the Scots used a technique of fighting where they would quickly rush at their targets, however that couldn't happen in a boggy field like Culloden. It was a battle that was destined to fail for the Jacobites.</p>

			<p>Our next stop was a much lighter, happier (and my favorite) stop - a sheep farm. We were greeted with a dozen border collies, who welcomed the belly rubs and ear scratches of the coach bus of college students. I found it fascinating that these dogs could easily herd sheep just by the sound of a whistle. Each dog had their own unique set of whistle commands that told them to go left, right, crouch, run fast to the sheep, back-up, and return to the farmer. When multiple dogs were herding sheep, you could hear the string of whistles and voice commands that had the dogs moving precisely where they needed to be. The dogs could split a sheep herd in 2, herd the sheep through a gate, and even get the sheep close enough for the farmer to grab one to shear. It was crazy how smart and well-trained these dogs were.</p>

			<p>The final stop of the trip was a scotch whiskey distillery called Blair Athol. They make a single malt whiskey that has a little otter on the front of the bottle. We were shown through the process of making a whiskey (first a barely beer, then distilled, and finally left in special barrels previously used for Spanish wine for a minimum of 12 years). We ended the tour tasting a dram of their whiskey, which they describe as a "little known fruity Highland whisky". It was a little potent for my taste, still slightly smoky in flavor because the water is from Scotland which is covered in peat. Blair Athol also sends it's non-single malt whiskey to other distilleries for a blended whiskey.</p>

			<p>I can officially say that I've experienced the Scottish highlands after two trips there. I particularly enjoyed learning about Scottish history and getting a view at some aspects of highland culture on this trip.</p>

			<p>Cheers!</p>
