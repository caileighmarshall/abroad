			<h1>Edinburgh Museums</h1>
			<h6><span class="light">Edinburgh, Scotland - </span> October 3, 2017</h6>
			
			<p>With high hopes and train tickets pre-booked to go to Glasgow this past Saturday, Olivia and I were met with train time tables that had 'CANCELLED' or 'DELAYED' beside every train that was supposed to leave Waverley Station that morning. We waited for a bit before hearing that the 9:15am train to Glasgow (it was almost 10am at the time) was cancelled. There was apparently a <a href="http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/our-region/edinburgh/rail-delays-in-edinburgh-expected-until-end-of-service-on-some-routes-1-4574402">"points issue"</a> (basically the part of the track that would switch between two lines) that caused the massive shutdown that made national news. We promptly got in line and had our tickets refunded, but other than having to re-book our Glasgow day trip for another weekend, we were in a far better place than most of the people stuck in the train station until the late afternoon.</p>

			<p>After having to cancel the Glasgow trip, we decided to make the most of the day and do touristy things in Edinburgh. We ended up exploring the Royal Mile, and visited St. Giles Cathedral (it is beautiful on the outside but a little too restored for my taste on the inside - photos also cost money so I opted for an outside photo instead). Since Olivia had not visited Edinburgh castle yet, we made the trek up the Royal Mile to the castle and wandered around, visiting the most interesting parts of the castle.</p>

			<p>It was getting close to lunch time, but we decided to go see an art museum before grabbing a bite to eat. We popped into the City Art Centre, which we saw while crossing the North Bridge from Princes Street towards the Royal Mile after leaving the train station earlier in the morning. The centre hosts traveling art exhibits and the one we ended up viewing was called Edinburgh Alphabet. It basically had a theme for each letter of the alphabet and displayed objects relating to that theme. One of my favorite letters was S for Sculpture, which is where I took my artsy "muse" selfie.</p>

			<p>When we had finished touring the 4 floors of artwork, we decided to grab some quick sandwiches at a cafe on the Royal Mile before exploring the Museum of Childhood up the street. The Museum of Childhood was the first museum in the world dedicated to the history of childhood, displaying toys and games from many generations. The museum also explored other aspects of growing up, like clothing and fashion. I think my favorite room was the doll room. It was definitely a little creepy seeing all the blank happy faces (and some seriously horrifying faces) of dolls sitting inside the glass cases. Each doll had its own personality, which is what caught my attention initially. It was also amazing how old some of the dolls were, especially because of how good of shape they were in for being wax or cloth dolls.</p>

			<p>Even with the cancellation of my Glasgow day trip, I still enjoyed exploring Edinburgh. Can't wait to get to Glasgow another day!</p>

			<br>
			<p>Cheers!</p>
