			<h1>Glasgow</h1>
			<h6><span class="light">Glasgow, Scotland - </span> November 7, 2017</h6>
			
			<p>After almost a month of waiting, Olivia and I were finally able to visit Glasgow on Saturday! We hopped on to an early morning train and arrived in Glasgow just after 10:30am. With only a tentative schedule of our day, we decided to first visit George Square, which is where the City Chambers and multiple statues of notable figures are located. While in the square, I spotted a traffic cone out of the corner of my eye and exclaimed that I had found the Duke of Wellington down a block from the square. We headed over to see the Duke of Wellington statue and take photos of his infamous cone head. He was located just outside of the Gallery of Modern Art and the traffic cone on his head is  meant to represent the humour of the locals and dates back to the 1980s. Basically, it was a bunch of drunk college students who started the tradition and made the government stop caring about trying to remove a traffic cone from a statue that somehow always ended back on the statue the next day.</p>

			<p>After having a good laugh over the Duke, we walked for about 20 minutes to the Glasgow Cathedral, which had both a gorgeous exterior and interior. I would safely say that the Glasgow Cathedral was much prettier than St. Giles and we could take photos in the Cathedral (unlike St. Giles, which charges you to take photos). The church is known as St. Mungo's Cathedral because the location of the current cathedral is allegedly where the patron saint of Glasgow, St. Mungo, built his church. We were able to see the tomb of St. Mungo in the lower crypt. The building itself was built in the late 12th century and is a picturesque example of Scottish Gothic architecture. It is also the only medieval cathedral on the Scottish mainland to have kept its roof intact during the Reformation. I enjoyed looking at all the stained glass windows and lamented at missing the necropolis we could see in the distance as we exited the cathedral.</p>

			<p>We had a nice lunch in the city center before figuring out how to take a bus to our next stop: Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum. All of Scotland's museums are free, so it was an easy choice on our list of things to do while in Glasgow. I really enjoyed looking at the paintings in the section of the museum titled Scottish Art because so many of the themes of the paintings I have either learned about while I've been here or I've been to the place that was the inspiration for the painting. The museum also had galleries on the Dutch old masters, the French impressionists, armor from around the world, animal taxidermies, extinct animals, ancient Egypt, busts of famous British people (including Queen Victoria, who was the monarch when the museum opened for the first time), and of course the super cool floating heads. The heads each display a different emotion including laughter and despair. The concept for the heads was to create an installation that encapsulated the word 'expression', and like a release of balloons, the heads bring lightness and humour to the museum.</p>

			<p>Our last official stop of the day was the Gallery of Modern Art, which was back at the Duke of Wellington statue. The gallery was quite small, so there wasn't a ton to see, but it was interesting to see how many of the galleries incorporated digital media into their design. When we emerged from the gallery, we also got to see the twinkling lights that made a canopy between the gallery and the buildings beside it, which I thought was absolutely magical. After a quiet evening of dinner at an Italian restaurant and a quick stop at a pub for a celebratory drink to having a good day in Glasgow, Olivia and I headed back to Edinburgh.</p>

			<p>After a delayed train back in October, it was well worth waiting until November to explore Glasgow.</p>

			<br>
			<p>Cheers!</p>
