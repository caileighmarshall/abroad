			<h1>Edinburgh Castle</h1>
			<h6><span class="light">Edinburgh, Scotland - </span> September 15, 2017</h6>
			
			<p>Legend has it that if a University of Edinburgh student visits Edinburgh castle before graduating, they will be cursed and never graduate. Luckily for me, I'm only spending the semester! I hopped on to one of the many city buses and headed toward the city center, specifically the Royal Mile. There are a lot of shops on the Royal Mile that sell things made of cashmere, sterling silver celtic jewelry, and the occasional bottle of whiskey. My destination was at the top of the Royal Mile surrounded by a fortified gate - Edinburgh Castle.</p>
			<p>Edinburgh Castle has dominated the landscape of Edinburgh for centuries. It was involved in many historical conflicts, from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Apparently it is the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world! It was originally a place of royal residency but in the 1700s the army took control. There are actually multiple different military-related museums like the Museum of the Royal Regiment of Scotland and the National War Museum of Scotland within the castle. The amount of military regalia was astounding and I enjoyed taking photos of the strange hats the Scottish army and cavalry had to wear over the years. My favorite hat was one that looked like a black Cheeto puff.</p>
			<p>Fun fact: the oldest building in Edinburgh is inside Edinburgh Castle! St. Margaret's Chapel was built in the 12th century (dating back to the reign of King David I, r.1124â€“1153), who built it as a private chapel for the royal family and dedicated it to his mother, Saint Margaret of Scotland. The chapel is still used for religious ceremonies, like weddings. It was quite a small chapel, probably the size of a small dining room. It is impressive that the chapel has lasted as long as it has, given the castle's history of getting besieged.</p>
			<p>The biggest attraction at Edinburgh Castle is most definitely the Scottish crown jewels. The Scottish crown jewels, known as The Honours of Scotland, were commissioned by James IV for his coronation but the first use of all the crown jewels together was for Mary Queen of Scots' coronation. Sadly there were no photos allowed of the crown, sceptre, or sword, but it was marvelous to look at.</p>
			<p>Overall, I had a lovely morning at the castle. Let's hope this adventure was a blessing rather than a curse!</p>

			<br>
			<p>Cheers!</p>
